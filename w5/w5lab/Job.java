Provides functionality of a Job object. 



Eg: 
Job job = new Job(1, 3); // this Job would arrive at time 1 and need 3 units of processing time

job.process(1, 2); // at time 2, we process this job for 1 unit of time.

System.out.println(job.getProcessingTimeRemaining()); // this will print 2, as there are still 2 units of processing time needed to finish this job.

job.process(2, 4); // at time 4, process this job for another 2 units of time.

System.out.println(job.isFinished()) // This prints true, as the job is now done.

System.out.println(job.timeInQueue()) // This prints 5, as the job arrived at time 1 and finished at time 6.
