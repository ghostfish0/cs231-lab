```java
//Write a file header with your name and class (file) purpose

//Define a rectangle class -- make sure to use capitals for the class name

	//define but don't initialize a width field of type double
	//make sure it has the correct access modifier (private)

	//define but don't initialize a height field of type double
	//make sure it has the correct access modifier

	//Make a constructor that takes in values for the width and height
	//Make sure both of your class fields are initialized by the end of 
	//the constructor!
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your constructor

	//Make a second constructor that takes in just the width 
	//and calls the first constructor with the width and the 
	//height equal (i.e. it makes a square)
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your constructor

	//Write a getter method for the width 
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your method

	//Write a getter method for the height
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your method

	//Write a setter method for the width
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your method

	//Write a setter method for the height
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your method

	//Write a method that called computeDiagonal that 
	//computes the length of the diagonal and returns it as a double
	//Your method should use the Math.sqrt and the Math.pow methods
	//Write a JavaDoc comment for your method
	//Write a single line comment for at least one
	//line in your method

	//Write a toString method that has the following format:
	//"Height: [[height]], Width: [[width]], Diagonal: [[length of diagonal]]"
	// eg: "Height: 3.0, Width: 4.0, Diagonal: 5.0"
